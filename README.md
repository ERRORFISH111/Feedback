# CoFH Feedback Repository

This repository is for tracking bugs and providing suggestions for ALL CoFH mods. It's far easier for us to check one place instead of a lot of separate trackers.

### Okay, so here's the deal.

The tracker is temporarily being closed down. The reasoning is basically this - 1.12.2 mods are incredibly well solidified and virtually every single issue reported here is user error or something a modpack has done.

Additionally, formal suggestions are not being accepted at this time, as there is a new framework being written for 1.14+.

If you wish to discuss the mods, or need tech support, please visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uRKrnbH)
